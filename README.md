## CNA421-Final Group Project
### Design and build a cloud phone system on Amazon Web Services 

#### In this project we will Install and set up a cloud phone system using 3CX. The AWS will host the phone system. And we will need a phone number and we can use Amazon Chime, in order to do that we will set up a SIP Trunk.
Using a cloud 3CX phone system is a great solution for:

•	Small businesses with limited resources.

•	Startups looking for a quick solution that can be easily scaled.

•	A home business owner.
