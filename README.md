## CNA421-Final Group Project
### Design and build a cloud phone system on Amazon Web Services 

#### In this project we will Install and set up a cloud phone system using 3CX. The AWS will host the phone system. And we will need a phone number and we can use Amazon Chime, in order to do that we will set up a SIP Trunk.
Using a cloud 3CX phone system is a great solution for:

•	Small businesses with limited resources.

•	Startups looking for a quick solution that can be easily scaled.

•	A home business owner.

#### Amazon Chime
Amazon Chime is a communications service that transforms online meetings with a secure, easy-to-use application that you can trust. Amazon Chime works seamlessly across your devices so that you can stay connected. You can use Amazon Chime for online meetings, video conferencing, calls, and chat. You can also share content, both inside and outside your organization. Amazon Chime frees you to work productively from anywhere.

#### Steps to setup the cloud phone system project:

Step 1: First start with EC2 instruction to craete the  key pair and manage Debian 9 subscription.

Step 2: Next follow 3cx file instructions to create an account and some set up on 3cx.

Step 3: The Amazon Chime file instructions will lead you to create an account with amazon chime, purchase a number, configur the SIP Trunk, and set up the outbound calling.

#### Now you have a phone system hosted on the cloud(AWS)!
